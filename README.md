- `apt-get`

If any package is not available on your system, or if you do not have permission to use said package, follow operating 
system guidance on installation and setup.

## Supported Operating Systems and Compute Platforms

## New to Voi
To set up a new Voi node, run the following command:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VoiNetwork/docker-swarm/main/install.sh)"
```

##  Using an Existing Account/Address with Mnemonic
If you have an existing account/address with a mnemonic that you want to use, set the VOINETWORK_IMPORT_ACCOUNT
environment variable to 1 and run the install script:

```bash
export VOINETWORK_IMPORT_ACCOUNT=1
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VoiNetwork/docker-swarm/main/install.sh)"
```

## Installing Without Wallet Setup

```bash
export VOINETWORK_TELEMETRY_NAME="my_custom_telemetry_name"
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VoiNetwork/docker-swarm/main/install.sh)"
```
Custom telemetry name can be combined with other environment variables.

## Useful Scripts
This section provides a collection of useful scripts for managing your Voi participation node. These scripts are 
designed to be executed within a running Docker container. They closely follow the commands outlined in the
[D13 guide](https://d13.co/posts/set-up-voi-participation-node/) for setting up a Voi participation node under Ubuntu 22.04.
### If you have the same problem read here
```bash
lighthouse@VM-0-10-ubuntu:~$ ~/voi/bin/get-account-mnemonic acat
permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.45/containers/json?filters=%7B%22name%2
```
This is caused by your ubuntu not having enough permissions don't worry about itã€‚
Please add enough permissions in front of the code sudo
for example
```bash
sudo ~/voi/bin/create-wallet <wallet_name>
```

Create a new wallet with the following command:
```bash
~/voi/bin/create-wallet <wallet_name>
```
